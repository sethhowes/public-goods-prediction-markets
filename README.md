# Cognoscenti
Cognoscenti is a business intelligence platform that brings together researchers with domain expertise and organizations with a thirst for knowledge to answer the toughest questions of our time and fund innovative research.

Cognoscenti would not be possible without the incredible tools of some of the sponsors. In our [detailed write-up](https://github.com/sethhowes/public-goods-prediction-markets/blob/main/Bounty_Explanations.pdf), we describe in detail the usage of those tools.
